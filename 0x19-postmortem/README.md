Executive Summary:
On 04/05/23 at about 12:00GMT , our platform experienced a system outage that lasted for 2hours. Investigation revealed that the cause of the outage was an inconsistency in the Nginx configuration files. This report details the incident, its root cause, impact, and recovery, as well as recommendations to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.

Incident:
On 04/05/23, we started receiving alerts from our monitoring system for several services being inaccessible. Upon investigation, our team found that Nginx was returning 502 Bad Gateway errors. This prevented customers from accessing our services and caused significant business impact.

Root Cause:
After conducting a detailed investigation, it was discovered that a configuration inconsistency was caused by a recent change made to one of the Nginx configuration files. This change affected the way Nginx handled traffic, leading to the misconfiguration.

Impact:
The system outage lasted for 2hours, impacting our customers' ability to access our services. The outage resulted in a significant financial impact for our business as we were unable to generate revenue for the duration of the incident. Additionally, the outage caused a loss of customer trust and confidence in our platform, which can lead to long-term negative impacts on our business.

Recovery:
The recovery process involved the identification and rollback of the problematic configuration file. The rollback fixed the configuration inconsistency, and the platform was operational again. Our team worked on restoring lost data for the affected customers and communicated the incident and resolution to them through a public statement.

Recommendations:
The incident revealed several areas that we need to improve our processes to prevent similar occurrences in the future, including:

1. Configuration Management: We need to implement a formal configuration management process to ensure that configuration changes made to our systems are properly reviewed before deployment.

2. Testing and Deployment: We need to improve our testing and deployment processes to ensure that changes are appropriately validated before releasing them to production.

3. Monitoring and Alerting: We need to enhance our monitoring and alerting strategies to improve our ability to detect and respond quickly to incidents.

4. Incident Response: We need to review our incident response process and make improvements to ensure a more efficient and effective response to future incidents.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Nginx configuration inconsistency was the root cause of the system outage. After identifying the root cause and resolving the issue, we implemented several recommendations to prevent similar occurrences in the future. We continue to focus on improving our processes, fine-tuning our monitoring systems, and engaging a cross-functional team to prevent system outages and maintain high availability for our customers.
